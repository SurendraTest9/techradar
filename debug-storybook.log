[11:24:19.802] [DEBUG] SB_CLI_UPGRADE_0003 (UpgradeStorybookToLowerVersionError): You are trying to upgrade Storybook to a lower version than the version currently installed. This is not supported.

Storybook version 10.1.11 was detected in your project, but you are trying to "upgrade" to version 10.0.7.

This usually happens when running the upgrade command without a version specifier, e.g. "npx storybook upgrade".
This will cause npm to run the globally cached storybook binary, which might be an older version.

Instead you should always run the Storybook CLI with a version specifier to force npm to download the latest version:

"npx storybook@latest upgrade"
